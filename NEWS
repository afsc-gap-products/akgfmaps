akgfmaps 3.3.0 (October 19, 2023)
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURE

- Added an include_grid_cell argument to make_2d_grid() that
  makes the function return columns with the center coordinates
  (lon_plot, lat_plot) of each grid cell prior to intersecting 
  with the user-provided sf object (passed to obj argument). 
  Centroids for intersected grid polygons are still returned by 
  the function for use in spatial analyses and index production 
  (e.g. VAST, sdmTMB) because they are the center of grid cells 
  after intersecting with stratum shapefiles. The centroid prior
  to intersection is more useful for plotting gridded data with-
  out prior transformation.
  
  EXAMPLE
  
  Grid cell centroids before intersection (regularly-spaced):
  
                +-----------+-----------+
                |           |           | 
                |           |           |
                |     x     |     x     |
                |           |           |
                |           |           |
                +-----------+-----------+

  Grid cell centroids after intersection (irregularly-spaced;
  useful for analyses that require accurate distances):

                +-----------+-----------+
                |          /|           |        
                |    x    / |           |
                |        /  |     x     |
                |       / x |           |
                |      /    |           |
                +-----------+-----------+
                
  Grid cell centroids for plotting after intersection (still 
  regularly-spaced):
  
                +-----------+-----------+
                |          /|           |        
                |         / |           |
                |     X  /  |     x     |
                |       /   |           |
                |      /    |           |
                +-----------+-----------+

akgfmaps 3.2.0 (October 6, 2023)
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIX

- Replaced Aleutian Islands survey grid shapefile 
  (inst/extdata/ai_grid.shp) with a new version that corrects 
  mislabeled stratum IDs. New shapefile provided by Ned Laman 
  (NOAA/AFSC).

- Replaced Aleutian Islands survey area shapefile 
  (inst/extdata/ai_area.shp) with a version that excludes 
  Bowers Ridge. 

FUNCTIONALITY CHANGES

- Modified get_base_layers() to filters out Aleutian Islands 
  survey.grid cells with STRATUM >= 800 (Bowers Ridge). This 
  change was made because Bowers Ridge stations are not part 
  of the standard survey grid, are not included in stratum area 
  calculations, are not used for index production and have not 
  been sampled by a RACE Aleutian Islands bottom trawl survey 
  since 1986. Bowers Ridge grid cells are still included in the 
  Aleutian Islands survey grid shapefile (/inst/extdata/ai_grid.shp).
  
- get_base_layers() now filters out Aleutian Islands and Gulf
  of Alaska survey.grid cells with STRATUM=0 (land). STRATUM 0 
  cells are still included in the survey grid shapefiles for 
  the Aleutian Islands (/inst/extdata/ai_grid.shp) and Gulf of 
  Alaska (/inst/extdata/goa_grid.shp).

    
NEW FEATURES 

- Added key.title.units argument to make_idw_map() that allows
  users to use their own unit label instead of the default 
  'CPUE (kg/ha)'. Example usage:
    - make_idw_map(key.title.units = 'CPUE (#/ha)')
    
- Added internal .check_region() function to check that user-
  specified region choices are valid and avoid cryptic error
  messages.


akgfmaps 3.1.1 (September 27, 2023)
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIX

Corrected INPFC_STRATUM name returned by get_inpfc_strata()  
from 'Southeast' to 'Southeastern'


akgfmaps 3.1.0 (August 31, 2023)
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

- Added a get_inpfc_strata() function that uses survey stratum
  shapefiles to create an INPFC stratum sf POLYGON for the goa
  or ai. The function can be called directly or through the
  get_base_layers() function. Code examples:
    - get_base_layers(select.region = "inpfc.goa")
    - get_base_layers(select.region = "inpfc.ai")
    - get_inpfc_strata(select.region = "goa")
    - get_inpfc_strata(select.region = "ai")

- Added a NMFS statistical area shapefile that can be accessed
  using a new get_nmfs_areas() function. The NMFS areas are also
  accessible using the get_base_layers function. Code examples:
    - get_base_layers(select.region = "nmfs")
    - get_nmfs_areas()

akgfmaps 3.0.0 (May 19, 2023)
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

- Added a make_idw_stack() function that creates multilayer 
  SpatRaster objects where interpolations are conducted by 
  grouping variables (such as YEAR). Intended to reduce 
  unnecessary run-times and post-hoc manipulation when 
  generating maps for multiple years.
  
FUNCTIONALITY CHANGES

- Removed raster and sp as dependencies and replaced raster 
  functions with terra functions ahead of the 2023 retirement 
  of rgdal and sp. Functions that previously generated 
  RasterLayer and RasterBrick objects (raster package) now 
  produce SpatRaster objects (terra package). Updated 
  vignettes and demos to reflect changes.
  
- To expedite transition away from sp and raster, 
  interp_2d_grid() and interp_3d_grid() are temporarily 
  removed pending redevelopment.
  
- Restructured imports and dependencies to account for changes
  since the release of R 4.0.
  


akgfmaps 2.3.0 (December 5, 2022)
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

- New option to return extrapolation.grid as an sf or stars 
  object using the extrapolation.grid.type argument in 
  make_idw_map(), where make_idw_map(extrapolation.grid.type = 'stars') 
  returns the extrapolation.grid as a stars object (default), 
  make_idw_map(extrapolation.grid.type = 'sf') returns an sf 
  object containing POLYGON/MULTIPOLYGON geometries that are 
  masked to the survey area extent, and 
  make_idw_map(extrapolation.grid.type = 'sf.simple') returns 
  an sf object containing POLYGON/MULTIPOLYGON geometries that 
  are maxed to the survey area extent and with lines simplified 
  using ms_simplify from the rmapshaper package.

- Added reproject_gebco() function to reproject GEBCO bathymetry 
  (netCDF file) to a new raster and calculate slope and aspect 
  rasters from the new bathymetry raster.
  
  
akgfmaps 2.2.0 (October 27, 2022)
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

  Add plotting options for EBS Slope subareas 1-6 ("bssa1", 
  "bssa2", etc.). For example, EBS slope subarea 1 layers and 
  default plot extents can be retrieved using:
  
  get_base_layers(select.region = "bssa1")


akgfmaps 2.1.0 (October 19, 2022)
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

- Added EBS slope survey area and stratum shapefiles. Stratum 
  shapefiles use stratum codes that match racebase.stratum.

- EBS slope layers can be accessed using:
  get_base_layers(select.region = "ebs.slope")
  
  
akgfmaps 2.0.0 (August 25, 2022)
----------------------------------------------------------------

FUNCTIONALITY CHANGES

- Shapefiles moved from /data/ to /inst/extdata/ to follow best 
  practices for R packages.
  
- Change AI and GOA subarea plot boundary method in get_base_layers() 
  to improve boundary delineation.
  
- Replaced Aleutian Islands survey grid shapefile with a file 
  that includes more grid cell data (ai_grid.shp)
  
akgfmaps 1.9.0 (May 24, 2022)
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

- Fix error in survey grid handling by get_base_layers. Previous-
  ly, get_base_layers() had an argument return.survey.grid that 
  had a default = FALSE. The function was only supposed to 
  return a survey grid when return.survey.grid = TRUE, but it 
  was returning the grid in the default CRS for the shapefile 
  when return.survey.grid = FALSE. The return.survey.grid 
  argument has been removed from the get_base_layers function 
  so the function returns a survey.grid object no matter what.

IMPROVEMENTS

- make_idw_map() extrapolation grid now uses the survey.area 
  bounding box to set the extent for the extrapolation grid, 
  replacing hard-coded presets.
  
- The default plot boundary (plot.boundary) returned by 
  make_idw_map() is now based on the survey.area bounding box, 
  replacing hard-coded presets.
  
  
akgfmaps 1.8.0 (March 16, 2022)
----------------------------------------------------------------


- Added a make_2d_grid() function to replicate a workflow for 
  producing interpolation grids in ArcMap using fishnet.
  
- Made functions that were designed for a specific project 
  internal functions and moved to utils.R (e.g. interp_2d_grid, 
  interp_3d_grid, normal_transformation, backtransform_normal.
